# Snake-game-2players
An interactive twist on the classic game of Snake for people who have friends. With WASD and arrow keys to control one blue and one green snake, two players will play against each other to collect the most food and grow into the largest snake. But be careful, running into the opponent snake's tail will spell certain doom.

Update: Test your skills against an algorithm if your friends are busy!
